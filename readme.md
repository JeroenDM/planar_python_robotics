# Planar Python Robotics

The main goal is to test robotic algorithms using only numpy and vanilla python. There are great libraries for robot simulation and related task, but installing them is always a hassle and very dependent on operating system and python version.

By only using Python 3.6 (from the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) I hope to have a robust framework that will work on any system for the next three years.
I also started using [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/), will see if I get into version trouble in the future...

The main drawback is that I have to write a lot of stuff myself. This is why I start with planar robotics. I'm not sure if it is usefull to do this. But it will be fun and I will learn a buch.
